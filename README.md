# hello-word
Just a "Hello".

I'm a new learner, and have few languages to use.
However, I'm here now. And I'd like to learn some more here to improve myself, of cause, at the same time, maybe I can have some time contribute to the community.
Whatever, you can call me Ray, I'm from China. Nice to meet you.
